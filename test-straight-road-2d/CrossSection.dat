Roadway Cross Section Input file for PERFCODE
	1	   <------ Number of segments to define cross section
Segment		Slope	Width[m] 
	1,     -0.03,   10.0

Note:  SLOPE is defined left to right with a negative slope
       corresponding to a loss of elevation moving from left to right.
       SEGMENTS are numbered from eta = 0 to eta = 1 so segment 1 is 
       on the right end of the domain.
