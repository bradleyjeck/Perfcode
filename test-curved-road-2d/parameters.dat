Boundary Conditions ( legal values are: MOC_KIN, NO_FLOW, 1D_FLOW, eastKIN, west_1D )
   .false.    <----- BCs vary by cell (.TRUE. or .FALSE.) [2]
   NO_FLOW   <----- NORTH boundary of domain	
   MOC_KIN   <----- SOUTH boundary of domain	
   NO_FLOW   <----- EAST boundary of domain	
   NO_FLOW   <----- WEST boundary of domain
Animation Options
   .false.    <----- Store Animation output? (.TRUE. or .FALSE.)
   100.      <----- Time interval for animation output [s]; confirm agreement with other times    		
Model Mode 
   2D        <----- 1D model is faster but only applies in certain cases


NOTES:
[1]  If PFC properties vary by cell put in the most common values here.
     The program will output a grid with the property of each cell in which
     you may put in variable properties and these will be read back in.
[2]  If BCs vary by cell put in the most common values for each domain
     boundary here.  A boundary condition grid for you to modify will 
     be written by the program and read back in.
